# Linter Overload

## for reals

<Notes>

How many of you are new to web development or static code analysis?
Put your hands up, don't be shy.

</Notes>

# What is a linter anyway?

<Flex
  style={{
    width: "100vw",
    height: "100vh",
    backgroundImage: "url('/assets/Annotation 2019-06-26 054217.png')",
    backgroundPosition: "50% 50%",
    backgroundRepeat: "no-repeat",
  }}
  justifyContent="center"
  alignItems="center"
/>

# Which one should we use?

<ul
  style={{
    padding: 0,
    listStyle: "none",
  }}

  <li style={{ fontSize: "3em" }}>JSLint</li>
  <li style={{ fontSize: "3em" }}>JSHint</li>
  <li style={{ fontSize: "3em" }}>ESLint</li>
  <li style={{ fontSize: "3em" }}>TSLint</li>
</ul>

<Notes>
  I got that list from first Google search result. Read it aloud. It's like a
  mumble rap song.

  In february this year Palantir announced TSList deprecation. Really talented
  people are working on `typescript-eslint` monorepo.

<ul
  style={{
    padding: 0,
    listStyle: "none",
    textAlign: "center",
  }}
>
  <li style={{ fontSize: "3em" }}>ESLint</li>
  <li style={{ fontSize: "3em" }}>
    <ins>Wotan</ins>
  </li>
</ul>

<Notes>
  And there's Wotan, new kid on the linter block. This March, Klaus Meinhardt,
  author of Wotan has published a VSCode extension for it. Why should I care
  about Wotan? Well -- it supports TSLint rules, preprocessors and TypeScript
  project references and doesn't introduce syntax errors with autofixes.
</Notes>

---

Okay, I know I should probably use ESLint or try out Wotan.

But **won't linter slow me down?**

---

# It will

<Notes>

You can procrastinate and argue about formatting rules as long as you want to.

</Notes>

---

# if you don't use Prettier.

<Notes>

Just get rid of the rules that don't help you.

That's it.
Fixing formatting because linter tells you to sucks ass.
Just use Prettier.
Even if you hate how your code looks like after being formatted by Prettier,
you can get used to it and you're not getting paid to format code,
you're getting paid for being productive and shipping features.

</Notes>

# What should we keep?

- üî™üêû Rules that help us catch bugs
- üòä‚ú® Rules that improve your product and help you avoid being a bad person like `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`

<Notes>

- Rules that help me catch bugs (sonarjs / sonarts and the like)
- Rules that improve your product and help you avoid being a bad person like `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`.

That's all. Now you're friends with your linter.

</Notes>

---

Can I already ditch TSLint for ESLint. **Does it hurt?**

<Notes>

Yeah, you can and yeah, it does. A little bit.
Few rules from TSLint have no equivalents in ESLint.
And some of the ESLint rules are just blatantly worse.
For example:
`ordered-imports` rule from TSLint is split to two in ESLint
(sort-imports and grouped-imports probably),
which of course, can conflict with each other.

</Notes>

---

But I already have ESLint and JS/TS codebase.

Can I use ESLint for both languages?
